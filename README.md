# Neda

Neda is an open source app Rust library for getting prayer times from multiple providers.
is good to make you own prayer times app really quickly and easily incha'Allah.
it is a part of [Neda](https://github.com/abdelkadouss/neda) project a free and open source cross platform - insha'Allah - salat (prayers) times app and library.

## Installation

### Clients (cli, gui)

You can install the Neda cli with cargo:

```sh
cargo install neda-cli
```

### GUI

Neda as project has a gui but it's not an implementation of this rust library. Is completely separate project written in Dart and Flutter not rust which is a cross platform. The reason why the Gui project are written in Dart is because I wanna to write once and run every where and Dart is a good fit for this purpose it's insha'Allah give a good performance and cross-cross-platform support (in short I think Dart is more ready for gui development).
You can find the Gui [here](https://github.com/aqhwan/neda)

### Library

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
neda = "0.1"
```

### Features

- default = ["aladhan-provider", "sqlite-storage"].
- aladhan-provider # default api provider.
- sqlite-storage # storage module, a sqlite db for offline access.
- client # utilities to help you make your own neda client (including a config_reader and some stuff).

## Usage

```rust
use chrono::Datelike;
use neda_lib::{
    core::{config::Config, prayers_times::Prayers, providers::Provider},
    providers::aladhan::AladhanProvider,
    storage::prayers_times_db::PrayersTimesDB,
};

fn main() {
    // Configure the options for fetching prayer times (location, country, and retrieval type: today, date, month, or year)
    let today = chrono::Local::now();
    let config = Config::new(
        today.year(),
        today.month(),
        today.day(),
        "mecca".to_string(),
        "SAU".to_string(),
        neda_lib::core::config::GetType::Month,
    );

    // Use the provider of your choice. Here, we use the Aladhan provider (the default implementation provided by Neda's original developer).
    // You can also use Neda's library to implement your own provider or use community-provided implementations (if exits).
    // Check `lib/providers/aladhan` for reference.
    let aladhan = AladhanProvider::new(config.clone());
    let prayers_times = aladhan.get_prayers_times(&config).unwrap();

    // Optional: Uncomment to inspect the prayer times.
    // println!("prayers_times is: {:#?}", prayers_times);

    // now you can store the prayer times (using a sqlite db) for offline access using the storage module.
    let db = PrayersTimesDB::new("lib/local.db".to_string());
    // You can examine the `lib/local.db` file afterward.

    match db {
        Ok(mut db) => {
            // this how push the prayers times to the db incha'Allah.
            match db.push(&prayers_times) {
                Ok(_) => {
                    println!("ignore pushing to the db");
                }
                _ => {
                    println!("pushing to the db");
                }
            };

            // now you can get the day prayers times from the db really easy incha'Allah using the get methods.
            let day_salawat = db.get_day_times(&prayers_times.from).unwrap();
            // specific prayer in specific date.
            let fjer = db.get_prayer_time(Prayers::Fajr, &prayers_times.from);
            println!("fjer is: {:#?}", fjer);
            println!("day prayeris : {:#?}", day_salawat);
        }
        Err(e) => {
            println!("Error: {:#?}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: you can find this example in `lib/examples/main.rs` file, and you can run it with `cargo run --example main`.

> Note: you can find an client implementation under `cli` crate and a gui soon incha'Allah.
